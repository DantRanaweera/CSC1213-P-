Practical No:07
Problem Specification:Change one data type in to another 
Implementation:
class ex07{
    public static void main (String[] args){
        char a1 = 'k';
        System.out.println("The Character Is: " + a1);

        int int1 = (int)a1;
        System.out.println("The Character Is: " + int1);

        double b1 = 156.987;
        System.out.println("The Value Is: " + b1);

        int int2 = (int)b1;
        System.out.println("The Value Is: " + int2);

        double b2 = int1;
        System.out.println("The Value Is: " + b2);


    }
}    
output:
The Character Is: k
The Character Is: 107
The Value Is: 156.987
The Value Is: 156
The Value Is: 107.0
Conclution: leard how to change data types into another data type
