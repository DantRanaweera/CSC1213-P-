Practical no:05
Problem Specification:Do the Mathenatical operetions by using two valuse
Implementation:
class ex05{
    public static void main (String[] args){
        int Num1 = 10;
        int Num2 = 19;


        System.out.println("Addition Is " + (Num1+Num2));
        System.out.println("Substraction Is " + (Num1-Num2));
        System.out.println("Multiplication Is " + ((Num1*Num2)));
        System.out.println("Division Is " + ((double)Num1/(double)Num2));
        System.out.println("Modulas Is " + (Num1%Num2));


    }
}
Output:
Addition Is 29
Substraction Is -9
Multiplication Is 190
Division Is 0.5263157894736842
Modulas Is 10
Conclusion:How to do the basic mathematic operations
